Good thinking — let's set you up for success no matter what happens.

Here’s a **Plan B** approach for your workshop if the SSL certificate for the OPeNDAP server is **not renewed in time**:

---

# 🧠 Plan B Strategy

✅ **Explain to participants why access might fail.**  
✅ **Offer a downloaded local version** of the NetCDF file as a backup.  
✅ **Demonstrate the *same* Python commands**, just with a local file path instead of a URL.  
✅ **Use this to teach an important real-world lesson** about technical resilience when working with remote data.

# 📜 Script for What You Can Say in the Workshop

---

> 🔵 *"In real-world research, we often rely on external data servers like OPeNDAP to access large scientific datasets remotely over the web. These servers need valid SSL certificates to ensure secure access."*

> 🔵 *"In this case, the OPeNDAP server I intended to use is temporarily unavailable via secure connection because its SSL certificate has expired. This is a common operational issue researchers might face."*

> 🔵 *"For today's session, I've downloaded the same NetCDF file locally so we can still fully practice the Python workflows. Once the server is updated, the exact same code will work with the remote URL again."*

> 🔵 *"Always plan for these real-world issues when working with remote datasets: have a local copy when possible!"*

# 🛠️ Technical Setup for Plan B

**Download the file locally yourself first:**

```bash
wget "https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/fileServer/data2/uuid/9604a1b0-13b6-4f23-bd6c-bb028591307c/wind-2008.nc"
```
(if wget doesn't work, you can download through browser.)

Put the file into your GitHub repo / Binder folder so participants can access it easily.

**Python code using local file:**

```python
import xarray as xr

# Local file fallback
ds = xr.open_dataset("wind-2008.nc")

print(ds)
ds['uwnd'].isel(time=0).plot()
```

You will just change:
```python
xr.open_dataset(URL)
```
to
```python
xr.open_dataset("wind-2008.nc")
```
No other code needs to change — **perfect teaching moment**!

# 📋 Action List to Prepare Plan B

| Task | Status |
|:---|:---|
| Download `wind-2008.nc` locally ✅ |  |
| Put it in the Binder repo ✅ |  |
| Prepare one version of notebook that loads local file ✅ |  |
| Prepare a few speaking points about remote vs local data ✅ |  |

# 🌟 Bonus Tip

You could even say:

> 🔵 *"In our workflow, switching between local and remote datasets is as easy as changing a single line of code. That's the power of using standardized data formats like NetCDF and interoperable libraries like xarray."*

(= showing them the **benefits of interoperability** in a real, live situation!)

Would you also like me to help you draft a **small checklist** that you can print or keep handy on the day of the workshop, so you’re totally calm and ready no matter what? 📋🚀  
It could be a 1-page "If live demo fails, do this" cheat sheet.
